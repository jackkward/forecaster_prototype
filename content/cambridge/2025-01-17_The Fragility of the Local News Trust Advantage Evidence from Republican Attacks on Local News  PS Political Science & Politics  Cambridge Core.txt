<SUMMARY>
This study investigated the impact of Republican politicians attacking local news outlets on public trust.
-  A survey experiment found that exposure to such attacks significantly decreased public trust in local news, particularly among Republicans.
-  Critically, this effect was not limited to Republicans; Democrats and Independents also exhibited negative reactions.
-  The findings suggest that local news credibility hinges on the *absence* of elite criticism, rather than the ability to withstand it.
-  The results parallel those observed regarding national media, highlighting the vulnerability of local news sources to political attacks.
-  Overall, the study emphasizes the fragility of public trust in local news when confronted with political opposition.


</SUMMARY>
<HIGHLIGHTS>
- This attack is particularly effective among Republicans, although it also leads Democrats and Independents to negatively shift their views of the local newspaper.
- Among those exposed to elite criticism of local news, overall trust and partisan divides between Republicans and Democrats resemble those for national media.
- This shows that the credibility of local news depends on the absence of elite criticism rather than resilience to it.

<CONTENT>
Abstract Today, few political news outlets receive universally favorable evaluations from the American public.

In retaining broad public approval, local media remain a notable exception that is important to understand.

We consider the durability of local news trust to criticism from politicians, focusing on Republican elites because they generally are more willing to attack the media than Democrats.

In a survey experiment, we find that exposure to a Republican politician’s attack on a local newspaper dramatically reduces the public’s trust in and intent to use local news.

This attack is particularly effective among Republicans, although it also leads Democrats and Independents to negatively shift their views of the local newspaper.

Among those exposed to elite criticism of local news, overall trust and partisan divides between Republicans and Democrats resemble those for national media.

This shows that the credibility of local news depends on the absence of elite criticism rather than resilience to it.
