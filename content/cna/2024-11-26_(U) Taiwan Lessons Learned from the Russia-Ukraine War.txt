Abstract
This report examines Taiwan’s lessons learned from the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Lessons learned by Taiwan
are already influencing Taiwan’s defense strategy and have created a sense of urgency for government leaders.

The
possibility of an invasion by the People’s Republic of China has been an ever-present reality for Taiwan’s leaders, but
the Russia-Ukraine conflict has provided an opportunity to learn from that experience and enact multifaceted reform
with the goal of turning the Taiwan military into a credible deterrent and warfighting force.

Taiwan has already begun
to restructure its ground forces and lengthen the terms of service for conscripts.

The Russia-Ukraine war has also
highlighted the role of uncrewed autonomous systems, the need for satellite communications connectivity, and the
importance of defending against cognitive warfare operations.

Taiwan Lessons Learned
from the Russia-Ukraine War
| www.cna.org i
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
“Ukraine today, Taiwan tomorrow” is now a
commonly used phrase in Taiwan.

For decades,
Taiwan treated a potential invasion by the People’s
Republic of China (PRC) as a remote possibility.
However, the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine has
made a PRC invasion of Taiwan appear more credible
and generated a sense of urgency among some leaders
in Taiwan.

This report examines the lessons learned
that Taiwan’s government and defense officials are
extracting from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
The Taiwan government and military have enacted
multifaceted reform with the goal of turning the
Taiwan military into a credible deterrent and
warfighting force.

Although some reform debates
predate the Russia-Ukraine war, Taiwan government
officials have taken lessons from Ukraine to guide
restructuring of Taiwan’s military forces.

Changes
include lengthening the terms of service for
conscripts and revising the military training cycle.
The Russia-Ukraine war has also highlighted the
role of uncrewed autonomous systems, emphasized
the need for satellite communications connectivity,
and reinforced the importance of defending against
cognitive warfare operations.

In this paper, we
describe five key lessons learned that the Taiwan
government is using to guide its efforts to turn
the Taiwan military into a credible deterrent and
warfighting force.
Lesson #1: Force structure matters
Ukraine’s Territorial Defense Force serves as a
model for Taiwan military restructuring to create
a defense in depth and improve deterrence by
raising the potential costs of a Taiwan military
invasion by the PRC.
Taiwan’s military is in the process of changing its
warfighting concept of operations.

The previous
system, composed of only active and reserve
forces, has been replaced by the “all-out defense”
system, which includes four pillars: (1) main forces,
(2) garrison forces, (3) reserve forces, and (4) civil
defense elements.

Each pillar has its own missions
and areas of responsibility.
Drawing on Ukraine’s experience with its Territorial
Defense Force, the main force will have better
trained and equipped units.
Garrison forces will be made up primarily of
conscripts and will be responsible for homeland
defense missions, such as protection of cities and
key government and military facilities.
In wartime, the reserve forces will be mobilized to
provide support to main and garrison units.
The civil defense system is intended to support
military operations, including such tasks as providing
medical assistance, performing rapid repair, offering
shelter, and maintaining law and order.
The creation of these additional systems is meant to
create a defense in depth and improve deterrence
by raising the potential costs of a Taiwan invasion.
Despite changes to warfighting concepts, the
role of the navy and air force appears relatively
unchanged.
Personnel changes, such as the length of service
obligations of conscripts, pertain to all three branches
of the Taiwan armed forces, but the all-out defense
mobilization plans appear to be primarily directed at
the Taiwan army.

The Republic of China Navy, according to the 2023
National Defense Report, will continue to “meet its
requirements for joint sea control missions,” and the
Republic of China Air Force will be responsible for
overall air defense operations.
However, it is unclear how personnel and training
changes initially focused on the army’s defense in
depth will affect how the navy and air force operate,
especially given the important role each service has
during wartime to deny the ability of the People’s
Liberation Army (PLA) to cross the Taiwan Strait and
during peacetime to contest PRC gray zone operations.
Lesson #2: Personnel are critical
for all-out defense strategy
Taiwan recognizes that well-trained personnel are
key to any defense but has not adopted Ukraine’s
popular resistance model.
The Russia-Ukraine war demonstrates the
importance of having sufficient numbers of welltrained personnel.

Taiwan has made the politically
unpopular decision to lengthen service commitments
for conscripts from four months to one year.

The
decision to increase conscription service length
is intended to increase the number of personnel
available for Taiwan’s defense and to make those
conscripts better trained.
Despite important personnel changes for the military,
the Taiwan government does not appear to support
peacetime measures to promote popular resistance.
The arming of private citizens runs counter to Taiwan’s
strict gun laws, and the formation of private militias
would likely raise command and control issues for the
Taiwan government and military.

Similarly, no source
surveyed for this study advocated for the creation
of an international volunteers unit such as Ukraine’s
International Legion for the Defense of Ukraine.
Lesson #3: Importance of
uncrewed systems
Uncrewed systems could increase costs for the
PRC and limit the costs for Taiwan.
Taiwan’s government and military have recognized
the utility of drone warfare and embarked on an
ambitious national drone program.

Uncrewed aerial
vehicles (UAVs) could potentially inflict costs on the
PRC and PLA while limiting losses for Taiwan.

The
Taiwan military has committed to acquiring more
than 700 military-grade UAVs and more than 7,000
commercial grade UAVs by 2028.

Considering the
heavy attrition of drones in the Russia-Ukraine
war, Taiwan may need to significantly expand its
acquisition of uncrewed systems to meet wartime
requirements.

The Taiwan Ministry of National
Defense has also sought to acquire counter-UAV
systems as part of its larger effort to produce and
acquire a variety of UAVs.
Lesson #4: Necessity of
connectivity
Satellite communications plans promise
to increase resilience and reduce Taiwan’s
telecommunications vulnerability.
In 2023, the Taiwan Ministry of Digital Affairs and
Chunghwa Telecom both signed agreements
with European companies to receive satellite
communication services and access low Earth orbit
networks.

The Taiwan Space Agency has suggested
that it may need 120 satellites for resilience, and
the Taiwan government has committed to acquiring
additional ground-based satellite communication
terminals.

However, the number of terminals is far
below the amount used by Ukraine.

Lesson #5: Cognitive warfare
concerns
PRC cognitive warfare activities remain a critical
issue for Taiwan.
PRC cognitive warfare activities predate the 2022
Russian invasion of Ukraine and remain a focus
of concern for Taiwan authorities.

In 2022, former
president Tsai Ing-wen called information warfare
operations the biggest challenge to Taiwan’s survival.
Although Taiwan researchers have monitored the
Russia-Ukraine war for trends in cognitive warfare,
Taiwan’s efforts to counter PRC cognitive warfare
operations largely draw upon its own experience.
Taiwan government and academic documents do
not discuss protracted warfare.
Despite a strong focus on the concerns associated
with cognitive warfare, discussions of the likelihood
of protracted warfare are not prominent.

Taiwan
sources surveyed for this report discuss the deterrent
and operational advantage of creating a defense
in depth, but there is little discussion of Taiwan’s
options if the conflict should turn into a stalemate.
Analysts argue that one reason for a defense-indepth strategy is to buy time for the US military to
actively become involved in defending Taiwan.

As the
Russia-Ukraine war continues, these observations
may change.
Indicators to watch
Predicting national resistance or will to fight is
incredibly difficult.

However, this study found
that Taiwan officials and researchers are taking
lessons learned from the Russia-Ukraine war
seriously.

Indicators to watch to evaluate how Taiwan
is applying its lessons learned include the following:
• Progress on implementation of the current
military training program
• Additional changes to the length of service
requirements for conscripts
• Changes to civil defense systems
• Acquisition and production of commercial
and military-grade uncrewed systems
• Increases in ground-based terminals
necessary for resilient communications
• Discussions of popular resistance plans,
the potential effects of protracted war, or
expansion of current mobilization systems

INTRODUCTION
“Ukraine today, Taiwan tomorrow” is now a
commonly used phrase in Taiwan.1 For decades,
Taiwan treated a potential invasion by the People’s
Republic of China (PRC) as a remote possibility.
However, the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine has
made a PRC invasion of Taiwan appear more credible
and generated a sense of urgency among some
leaders in Taiwan.

This report examines the lessons
learned that Taiwan government and defense officials
are extracting from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
According to Taiwan’s 2023 National Defense Report,
the Russia-Ukraine war has taught Taiwan that “a
totalitarian regime can ignore international rules
and kick off invasion for the sake of its own national
interests or political assertions.”2
The Taiwan government and military have
enacted multifaceted reform with the goal
of turning the Taiwan military into a credible
deterrent and warfighting force.

Although some
reform debates predate the Russia-Ukraine war,
Taiwan government officials have taken lessons from
Ukraine to guide restructuring of Taiwan’s military
forces.

Changes include lengthening the terms of
service for conscripts and revising the military training
cycle.

The Russia-Ukraine war also highlighted the
role of uncrewed autonomous systems, emphasized
the need for satellite communications connectivity,
and reinforced the importance of defending against
cognitive warfare operations.
Based primarily on Taiwan government and military
policy documents and Taiwan military analyst
assessments of the Russia-Ukraine war, we argue
that the Russia-Ukraine war has resulted in profound
changes in Taiwan’s approach to its defense, in large
part because of the increased sense of urgency.

Based
on these lessons learned, the Taiwan government and
military are attempting to reform the Taiwan military
into a credible deterrent and warfighting force.
Similarities exist between Ukraine and Taiwan.
Both are democracies threatened by the territorial
ambitions of a larger and more powerful neighbor.
Both have strong linguistic, cultural, and economic
ties with their larger neighbor.

Important differences
also exist between Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and
a potential PRC invasion of Taiwan, however.

Most
notably, Ukraine has land borders, and Taiwan is
an island, which both benefits and disadvantages
Taiwan.

PRC efforts to invade Taiwan would be
greatly complicated by the necessity to conduct an
amphibious landing on Taiwan’s shores.

In contrast,
Ukraine’s land borders facilitate international support
with the flow of people and supplies, whereas a
blockade of Taiwan could cut off the island from
material support.

Although Ukraine’s sovereignty is
supported by many countries, Taiwan’s unique status
could limit its ability to garner international support.
Based on study of the Russia-Ukraine conflict,
the Taiwan Ministry of National Defense (MND)
asserts that Taiwan’s commitment to democracy
and freedom will generate support among the
international community.

According to the Taiwan
MND, “the majority of countries have admitted
that peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait are
connected with peace, stability, and prosperity not
only in the Indo-Pacific, but also in the international
community.”3 The Taiwan MND also asserts that
Taiwan must be able to defend itself for others to
come to its aid.4
Taiwan has begun to adjust how it will carry out
its defense strategy of “effective deterrence,

from the Russia-Ukraine War

resolute defense.”5 Greater attention is now being
placed on creating a defense in depth intended
to wear down the People’s Liberation Army (PLA)
landing forces on the island if it gains and breaks out
of a lodgment on Taiwan.6 To carry out this revised
approach, Taiwan has restructured the way in which
it conceptualizes warfighting by the army, increased
service requirements for conscripts, and begun to
revamp its training.

The Taiwan government has
also undertaken an ambitious program to develop
uncrewed capabilities, strengthen efforts to combat
PRC cognitive warfare operations, and make its
command and control (C2) system more resilient
through space-based communication systems.
Although it is too soon to evaluate the effectiveness
of these reforms, we identify the main reform efforts
in order to outline a research agenda, and we discuss
indicators to watch.

Indicators include the acquisition
of uncrewed and satellite communication systems,
societal acceptance of changes to the conscription
system, and the emphasis on reserve, garrison, and
civil defense forces to support the military in the
event of conflict.
Approach and organization
This CNA-initiated project conducted an initial
review of Taiwan official and military writings related
to analysis of the Russia-Ukraine war.

At its core,
our main research question was as follows: what
lessons learned have Taiwan analysts gathered and
assessed related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict?
Initial research focused on vernacular primary source
materials from Taiwan, including a survey of official
government documents and military journals.

We
consulted materials on Taiwan’s general defense
strategy, defense structure, drone warfare, cognitive
and information warfare, use of reserve forces,
satellite communications,
