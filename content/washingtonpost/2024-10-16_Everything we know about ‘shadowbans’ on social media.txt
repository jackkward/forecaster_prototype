<SUMMARY>
This article explores the phenomenon of "shadowbans" on social media, where users believe their posts are being suppressed by algorithms without explicit explanation.
-  The article highlights the lack of transparency in social media algorithms and the difficulty users face in determining whether their content is being intentionally limited.
-  While many users suspect their posts are being hidden from general feeds, few have concrete evidence.
-  The article also touches on reasons why companies might limit content, potential types of content affected, and how to potentially identify algorithmic suppression.
-  Ultimately, the article questions whether these limitations constitute censorship, content moderation, or another form of algorithmic control.


</SUMMARY>
<HIGHLIGHTS>
- We turn to social apps for news, political discussions and up-to-date information, but much of what we see is decided by sets of algorithms that try to prioritize the content we like while showing us ads at regular intervals.
- How those algorithms make decisions is largely a black box , and critics have long called on social media companies to be more transparent.
- Major political figures have accused the companies of using algorithms to censor speech, while regular users worry their posts are being suppressed based on biased criteria.
- We asked Washington Post readers to share their stories about “shadowbans," the real or perceived suppression of a person’s posts, and many suspected that their posts were being shown to friends but hidden on feeds.
- Few had proof this was happening.

Have you ever had a post fall flat — no likes, no comments — and wondered whether some all-seeing social media algorithm was punishing you? We turn to social apps for news, political discussions and up-to-date information, but much of what we see is decided by sets of algorithms that try to prioritize the content we like while showing us ads at regular intervals.

How those algorithms make decisions is largely a black box , and critics have long called on social media companies to be more transparent.

Major political figures have accused the companies of using algorithms to censor speech, while regular users worry their posts are being suppressed based on biased criteria.

We asked Washington Post readers to share their stories about “shadowbans," the real or perceived suppression of a person’s posts, and many suspected that their posts were being shown to friends but hidden on feeds.

Few had proof this was happening.

“It feels like whack-a-mole,” said Leah Carey, a 50-year-old sex educator who said she’s constantly trying to infer what might get her posts kicked off Instagram’s main feed and Explore tab.

“On any given day, what you did last week might no longer work.

” Here’s what you need to know about shadowbanning What to know What is ‘shadowbanning,’ or ‘algorithmic suppression’? Why do companies limit some content? What types of content get limited? How do I know if my content is being limited? Is this censorship, content moderation or something else? Do social platforms penalize accounts if a piece of content gets limited?
