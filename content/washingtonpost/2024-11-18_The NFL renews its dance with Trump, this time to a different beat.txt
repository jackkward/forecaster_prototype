<SUMMARY>
NFL players, including Brock Bowers, Za'Darius Smith, and Malcolm Rodriguez, have been performing the "Trump dance" after scoring touchdowns.
-  This dance, reminiscent of President Trump's signature campaign moves, is notable for its recent appearance and contrasts with the generally antagonistic relationship between NFL players and Trump during his first term.
-  Some analysts suggest this new show of support reflects a shift in cultural attitudes among young men, particularly those in the NFL, who may not see the protests of 2016 with the same intensity as older generations.
-  The article also points to a potential correlation between Trump's success in courting young men and this new alignment among players.
-  Ultimately, whether this is a sign of support or mockery remains ambiguous.

- “For adults, it seems like 2016 was three blinks ago,” Suddler said.
- “Even a 25-year-old NFL player, you have to remember that Kaepernick for them was an early high school, late middle kind of memory.
- And they just weren’t thinking about politics in the same kind of way.” University of North Carolina history professor Matthew Andrews, who studies the intersection of politics and sports, noted that demonstrations by Kaepernick and Trump-dancing players are not comparable on their face.
- One was solemn expression.
- The other is playful celebration.

In euphoric moments typically reserved for spiked footballs and high-fives, a handful of NFL players Sunday afternoon celebrated with a dance striking for both its physical awkwardness and political undertones.

The mild hip gyrations paired with slightly flailing, alternating arm punches were subtle but unmistakable: It was the “Trump dance,” the swaying moves President-elect Donald Trump made a signature at his rallies, usually while “YMCA” blared.

Las Vegas Raiders tight end Brock Bowers did the Trump dance after scoring a touchdown.

Detroit Lions defensive players Za’Darius Smith and Malcolm Rodriguez shimmied together after a sack.

Tennessee Titans wide receivers Calvin Ridley and Nick Westbrook-Ikhine performed the dance in the back of the end zone.

Just a handful of the roughly 3,000 players who will cycle through the NFL this season performed the dance, hardly evidence in any direction of a how diverse workforce views the president-elect.

It’s not even clear whether the players were exhibiting support or simply performing a dance they find amusing.

“While wearing a MAGA hat is a definitive show of support, the dance is a grayer area — mocking? Supportive? Just fun?” said Amy Bass, Manhattanville University professor of sport studies.

“The jury is out; I don’t think it is as easy to connect it to a political side.” Still, the Trump-inspired celebrations may offer a window into cultural shifts that have occurred both within and outside the country’s most popular sport since Trump’s presidency.

The trend most resonantly could be seen as a reflection of Trump’s success in courting young men.

According to a Tufts University poll, 56 percent of men aged 18-29 — the demographic most NFL players fall into — voted for Trump, a 15 percent increase over 2020.

NFL players have openly associated themselves with Trump in a way they did not during his first term.

During Trump’s 2015 presidential campaign, quarterback Tom Brady stored a “Make America Great Again” hat in his locker but removed it from view of reporters after persistent questions, which he dodged.

Otherwise, NFL players’ public relationship with Trump was almost uniformly antagonistic, largely owing to Trump’s approach to Colin Kaepernick’s kneeling protest of police brutality during the national anthem.

So even the recent small ripples of support for Trump stand in stark contrast to players’ public stances during his first term.

President-elect Donald Trump danced throughout the campaign trail; now NFL players and a UFC fighter have celebrated their scores with Trump’s signature moves.

“There’s a particular kind of distance from that moment of 2016 where you do see NFL players a little more comfortable showing their allegiance in that way.” Working on a college campus, Suddler has grown attuned to how quickly time passes for young people.

The way Trump turned Kaepernick into a political bludgeon and characterized such a protester as a “son of a bitch” does not reverberate for current players as it would have even a handful of years ago.

“For adults, it seems like 2016 was three blinks ago,” Suddler said.

“Even a 25-year-old NFL player, you have to remember that Kaepernick for them was an early high school, late middle kind of memory.

And they just weren’t thinking about politics in the same kind of way.” University of North Carolina history professor Matthew Andrews, who studies the intersection of politics and sports, noted that demonstrations by Kaepernick and Trump-dancing players are not comparable on their face.

One was solemn expression.

The other is playful celebration.

But he also noted a telling difference in their reception.

Trump and his supporters online quickly seized upon and promoted the players’ celebrations as a cultural triumph.

“The vibe shift is unstoppable,” conservative sports media company Outkick wrote on X.

Many of those who decried Kaepernick using sports as a political platform cheer on-field support for Trump.

“This is definitely a contradiction of the conservative maxim to ‘keep politics out of sports’ — something we heard endlessly from Trump and his supporters in 2016 as a way of further rejecting and silencing Colin Kaepernick’s statement,” Andrews said.

“Over the years, what I have realized is that when someone says, ‘Keep politics out of sports,’ what they mean is, ‘Keep those politics out of sports.’ ” For the NFL, any interaction with Trump’s first administration had roughly the effect of a chainsaw thrown in a bath tub: messy, problematic and unpredictable.

Trump used the league as a political battleground, starting when he profanely called on team owners to “fire” players who, like Kaepernick, protested police violence during the national anthem by kneeling.

The inflamed rhetoric threatened to swallow the sport whole, culminating in billionaire team owners joining players on the field for the anthem and the league later painting messages of unity on the field near the end zones.

As Trump hammered at the issue, polling showed the NFL’s decrease in ratings was tied to fans’ disapproval of the demonstrations.

As some players have publicly warmed to Trump, there are remnants of the league’s unease.

A Raiders public relations official cut short Bowers’s media session after he answered a question about the dance, and the team did not include his comment in the transcript it sent to reporters.

The NFL does not consider the Trump dance political demonstration.

“It’s considered a dance,” NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said.

“It’s not an issue.” Per its rule book, the league penalizes or fines players only for celebrations it deems as prolonged or excessive, sexually suggestive or violent, or involving a prop.

Moves that pay homage to — or perhaps poke fun at — the president-elect are okay.

That draws a distinction with another form of political tribute.

After an Oct.

27 game, San Francisco 49ers defensive end Nick Bosa crashed his teammates’ postgame interview on “Sunday Night Football” while wearing and gesturing at a “Make America Great Again” hat.

On Nov.

9, the NFL fined him $11,225 for displaying a “personal message” in violation of equipment and uniform rules.

“It was well worth it,” Bosa told reporters the day after the election, when the NFL was still reviewing his case.

“Clearly, the nation spoke.

And we got what we got.” In the realm of sports, the miming of Trump’s moves surfaced before Sunday.

On his Truth Social platform, Trump shared a video of West Virginia quarterback Nicco Marchiol swaying and gently punching the air after he scored a touchdown.

Sen.

Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) said on social media that she sent the video to Trump, and Marchiol subsequently thanked Capito and re-shared Trump promoting his dance.

The overlap of the dance and sports reached a tipping point Saturday night during a UFC event at Madison Square Garden.

With Trump sitting ringside with businessman Elon Musk, star fighter Jon Jones performed the dance inside the octagon after his victory.

He then walked to Trump and handed him his championship belt.

“I’ve seen everyone do it,” Bowers, a rookie tight end, told reporters after the Raiders’ loss to the Miami Dolphins.

“I watched the UFC fight last night, and Jon Jones did it.

I like watching UFC, so I saw it and thought it was cool.” Asked Brock Bowers about his Trump TD celly: “I’ve seen everyone do it.

I watched the UFC fight last night and Jon Jones did it.

I like watching UFC so I saw it, and thought it was cool.” Raiders PR ended his postgame availability after my question.

 The dance’s spread into the NFL may signify Trump clawing back territory Democrats had attempted to claim during the campaign.

Football is one of America’s final pastimes consumed by people of all races, genders and political leanings.

Democrats created ties to football, heavily leaning into vice-presidential candidate Tim Walz as a football coach, as one example.

The emergence of the Trump dance shows the left was essentially playing a road game.

“We’ve been having lots of conversations about what it is about football that seems to be way more prevalent than a sport like basketball in terms of support the incoming president has received,” Suddler said.

At Trump’s election victory speech, UFC President Dana White thanked retired NFL players Taylor Lewan and Will Compton, whose “Bussin’ With the Boys” podcast he appeared on during the campaign.

“What I think it does do, to a degree, is eliminate football from leftist politics again despite the fact that the Democratic Party — Coach Walz, Taylor [Swift] and Travis [Kelce], Colin Allred and game day flyovers — tried to co-opt football for its own political devices,” Bass said.

For Bass, the Trump dance provided a reminder that sports provide a platform for political statements of all persuasions.

She pointed out that after sprinters John Carlos and Tommie Smith raised their fists in black gloves on the podium at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics , boxer George Foreman waved a U.S.

flag around the ring.

“There’s a lot of room in sport for politics,” Bass said.

“And players don’t stop being who they are, believing in what they believe in, when they hit the field.”
