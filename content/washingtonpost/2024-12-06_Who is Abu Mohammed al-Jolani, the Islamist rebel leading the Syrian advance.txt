Amid a rebel offensive that stunned the Syrian regime and led to major losses of territory, the 42-year-old man leading it made a surprising strategic decision: He used his real name.

In an official message Thursday after its fighters entered Hama, the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) Islamist militant group shared a message that was signed Ahmed al-Sharaa — the birth name of a rebel leader better known by his nom de guerre, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani.

The move marks a broader shift for Jolani.

Once a shadowy figure who rarely showed his face, Jolani served time in a U.S.

prison in Iraq before becoming the commander of an al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria’s brutal, multipronged civil war.

Even now, there is a $10 million U.S.

reward for information that leads to his capture.

But in recent weeks, Jolani has become the public face of the most successful rebel advance in Syria in years, credited as the driving force behind a stunning offensive that captured Syria’s second-largest city, Aleppo, from forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

Aaron Zelin, a fellow at the Washington Institute, said that by using Jolani’s real name, HTS hoped to show “he’s just a regular guy.” He may be anything but.

“Jolani is young, smart and extremely ambitious,” said Charles Lister, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, adding that he has also been ruthless in the past in purging his rivals and potential future threats.

“Make no mistake, he wants to be seen as the kingmaker himself,” Lister said.

What to know Where did Jolani come from? How did he become involved in Syria’s civil war? Why did his group break with al-Qaeda? What has he done since the collapse of the Islamic State? What sort of Syria does Jolani envisage?
