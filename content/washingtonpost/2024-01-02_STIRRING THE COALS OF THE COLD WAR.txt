The May 20 Rowland Evans and Robert Novak column {op-ed} alleged that a Soviet SS-20 missile was located in Cuba in violation of the 1962 Khrushchev-Kennedy accords.

The White House and the State Department denied these claims after consulting with appropriate intelligence agencies.

Unfortunately, the column by Mr.

Evans and Mr.

Novak is another in a series of gossip and rumor-based articles that try to paint Cuba as a threat to U.S.

security, to keep alive the almost extinguished coals of Cold War thinking.

On April 1, Jeane Kirkpatrick {op-ed} charged that a nuclear power plant being constructed in Cuba would pose a security threat to the United States, because Cuba was only two years away from producing weapons-grade plutonium.

She mixed this invention with the defection of a Cuban MiG-23 pilot who landed undetected by U.S.

radar in Key West on March 20.

Cuban President Fidel Castro, she strongly implied, might have been testing U.S.

radar so that he could load a nuclear weapon on a MiG and drop it on the Turkey Point nuclear power plant in Florida, creating a Chernobyl-scale disaster.

Both columns continue to promote the ridiculous and dangerous belief that Cuba poses a nuclear threat to the United States.

For three decades, the United States has made Cuba a target of low-intensity war.

Eight different U.S.

administrations have posed real and direct threats to Cuba's security.

U.S.

efforts to topple the Cuban government have included a bizarre mixture of assassination attempts against Cuban leaders, a failed CIA-backed invasion at the Bay of Pigs and a 30-year economic embargo, which defies law and decency and continues to this day.
